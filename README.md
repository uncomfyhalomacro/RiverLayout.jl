# RiverLayout.jl
A simple layout generator code for https://github.com/riverwm/river in Julia. 

## An experiment while learning C and Julia with my favorite Wayland compositor by managing/generating layouts through ccall (WIP)

## TODO

- [ ] Create a layout.c file (probably copy it from the contrib folder in river
  but well idk :shrug:)
